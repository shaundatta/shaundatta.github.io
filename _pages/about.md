I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Theory Group at Stanford University, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Adam Bouland](https://theory.stanford.edu/~abouland/). Previously, I was an undergraduate in Physics and Mathematics with Computer Science at MIT. During the 2018-9 academic year I was a member of [Michael Wolf's](https://www.math.cit.tum.de/en/math/people/professors/wolf-michael/) group at [TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/), where I was supported by a DAAD research grant, and in the spring of 2022 I was a visiting doctoral student with [Matthias Christandl](https://www.math.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/475476) at [QMATH](https://qmath.ku.dk/) in Copenhagen. I was a research intern at IBM Quantum in 2022 and Intel Labs in 2019.
