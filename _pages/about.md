I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Theory Group at Stanford University, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Adam Bouland](https://theory.stanford.edu/~abouland/). Previously, I was an undergraduate in Physics and Mathematics with Computer Science at MIT. During the 2018-9 academic year I was a member of [Michael Wolf](https://www.math.cit.tum.de/en/math/people/professors/wolf-michael/)'s group at [TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/), where I was supported by a DAAD research grant, and in the spring of 2022 I was a visiting doctoral student with [Matthias Christandl](https://www.math.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/475476) at [QMATH](https://qmath.ku.dk/) in Copenhagen. I was a research intern at IBM Quantum in 2022 and Intel Labs in 2019. I am grateful to be supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

I am currently a [long-term visitor](https://simons.berkeley.edu/people/shaun-datta) at the Simons Institute for its program on [Quantum Algorithms, Complexity, and Fault Tolerance](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/quantum-algorithms-complexity-fault-tolerance).

Much of my research centers on the nexus of quantum complexity theory and near-term quantum computation. Of particular interest is how reasoning about how complexity classes up in the heavens (often called ["structural complexity"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_complexity_theory)) can say something about real experiments here on Earth. I am also animated by questions in quantum simulation and quantum learning theory.
